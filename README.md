JS client to manipulate form models


TODO
----

* Modify UI to match the wanted template from balsamiq.

* Add description feature : input in the UI + link with model

* Remove all debug UI (debug div and buttons)


Known bugs
----------

* Some Ajax calls create client error : 2nd save of a form and instance creation

* http error 404 for the OPTIONS method when the form deletion is called
